# ECemble

ECemble is an ensemble machine learning method to predict enzyme and enzyme classes from unannotated protein sequences. ECemble is a hierarchical prediction method where it first predicts if a protein is an enzyme or a non-enzyme, and the subsequently predict specific class and subclass of an enzyme in the EC number hierarchy. The predictions are selected when at least two of the three top-performing ML classifiers show consistent predictions.
